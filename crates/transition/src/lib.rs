//! Composable, representable, executable state machines.
//!
//! A reducer is the total function `State × Event → State × Effects`. It does
//! not execute effects, choose a transport, own locks, or prescribe storage.
//! Those omissions are the useful boundary: interpreters may be concurrent,
//! asynchronous, simulated, or model checked without changing the reducer.
//!
//! Entity lifecycle management is one application. Actor supervision,
//! protocol sessions, retry policies, and resource ownership can use the same
//! kernel when their decisions are deterministic and their effects can be
//! represented as data. It is not appropriate for algorithms whose state is
//! intrinsically external or whose correctness depends on hidden I/O.
//!
//! [`Machine`] retains sequential, product, and choice composition as concrete
//! structure. The same value can therefore be executed with [`Machine::step`]
//! and inspected with [`Machine::describe`]. Composition is static and
//! allocation-free: Rust monomorphizes the concrete composition tree.
//!
//! Bombay Entity can use this to keep its executable lifecycle synchronized
//! with topology documentation and reference models. Actorpass could later use
//! it for supervision or incarnation protocols without depending on entity
//! semantics. It should not replace Actorpass's event loop, mailbox, scheduler,
//! or resource ownership: those are interpreters and runtime capabilities, not
//! deterministic machine descriptions.
